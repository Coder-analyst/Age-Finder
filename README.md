# **Future Age Calculator**

A simple Python program that calculates your age after a specified number of years. This project is implemented using only Python's built-in features, making it an excellent example of how to create beginner-friendly programs without relying on external libraries.

---

## **Features**
- Takes user input for:
  - Current age.
  - Number of years into the future.
- Validates user inputs to ensure they are positive integers.
- Computes and displays the user's age after the specified number of years.
- Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs.

---

## **How It Works**
1. The program prompts the user to enter their current age.
2. The user is asked to input the number of years to calculate into the future.
3. The program validates both inputs:
   - Ensures they are numeric.
   - Ensures they are positive numbers.
4. After validation, the program calculates the future age and displays the result.

---

## **Use Cases**
- Practice basic input validation in Python.
- Learn how to work with user input and simple arithmetic operations.
- Understand how to build beginner-level projects without external dependencies.

---

## **Example Output**
```
Enter your current age: 25
Enter the number of years into the future: 10
In 10 years, you will be 35 years old.
